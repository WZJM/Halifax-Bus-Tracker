## 📖 Overview

This project visualizes real-time GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data from Halifax Transit on an interactive map. Unlike standard map apps, this tracker focuses on:
* **Raw Real-Time Accuracy:** Updates every 15 seconds directly from the transit authority.
* **Stale Data Detection:** Alerting users if the official feed goes down or gets stuck.
* **Route Filtering:** Ability to watch specific routes while hiding others.
* **Mobile Performance:** Optimized touch targets and rendering for phones.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-Time Tracking:** Buses move and update location, bearing, and speed every 15 seconds.
* **Smart Search & Filter:** * Search for routes by number (e.g., "90") or name.
    * Filters the map to show *only* the selected buses.
    * Includes a static "Master List" so routes appear in the search even if no buses are currently running (e.g., weekends).
* **Localization (i18n):** Fully translated interface in **English**, **French**, and **Chinese (Simplified)**.
* **Stale Data Indicators:** * The backend monitors the data feed integrity.
    * A "Warning" icon appears automatically if the data hasn't changed in >60 seconds.
* **User Geolocation:** "Locate Me" button to see buses near your physical location.
